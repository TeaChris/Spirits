                These are the ability to build, the ability to protect, the ability to fight, the ability to bless and curse and the ability to be better.Our unique abilities are from birth and we grow to master them,
                and the sole purpose of these abilities is to help make he world a better place for other Descendants. Some abilities are more unique than others but the Spirits always have a reason for giving each of us the
                abilities we are born with. As a Descendant, you must find your gift as early as possible, because ou may have been chosenn by a god. We are one with the Spirits and so we have the freedom to be what we want to
                be. We are the Descendants of the Spirits. The Spirits Of Africa.

                        philosophy of “ubuntu”, a Nguni Bantu term meaning "humanity”. For us to thrive, we must believe in ourselves and 
                        work together for the future we want to build.

                        African mythology full of intrigue and wonder, but doesn’t get the recognition it deserves.
                        The continent is brimming with so many beautiful stories about Africa and African mythology, 
                        but very often these stories are poorly expressed, or remain untold – our inspiration at SOA is to change that!

                        A group of five young Africans with a zeal to rewrite the narrative and build Africa from Africa. We’re introverts, but we’ve chosen to break out of our shells and
                         soar to the highest peak to preach the gospel of Human Resource Development. Three of the five are creative graphic artists and the other two are talented young men 
                        who fell in love with the SOA project idea and are willing to give 200% to its success. We’ve made significant progress so far and we will continue to forge ahead.
